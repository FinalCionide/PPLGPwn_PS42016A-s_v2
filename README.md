Thanks to the main creator ive forked his project to run on a specific console.
A lot of users who own MAC OS Laptop or computer don't have access to windows or an ethernet port.

This is a fork of PPPwn (-> PPLGPwn) which works on LG tvs which uses the RJ45 port to communicate over PPPoE
If you have an LG tv, great. 
If you DONT have an LG tv, Go back to google for your situation, this is for LG WEB OS.

This is for PS4 Model 2016A Slim Running FW 11.00 only.

Using Mac OS SSH to your television isn't the wisest option, if you keep getting WAITING FOR STAGE 2 shut off PS4 every time, 
this fork may help via ssh.

FinalCionide for helping Mac users with this updated CURL for the original project for PS4 users with consoles model: 2016A.

HOW DO I USE THIS?
Download iTerm2 Mac OS
type for example:   ssh root@192.168.1.195     (THE IP IS YOUR LG TELEVISION IP)
type the password:  alpine

run command  WGET;

wget https://github.com/FinalCionide/PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s_v2/releases/download/Release/install.sh

it will show this 100% |********************************|

type chmod +x ./install.sh
     -  this makes the files we just downloading executable since its a shell script.

 run the program via the console now  TYPE:  ./install.sh

 If you miss this step on mac os, you will get Permission Denied.

 NOTE IF YOU GET CANT DOWNLOAD (FILE install.sh Already exists)  type: rm install.sh

 This will delete the file so you can run WGET. This usually happens when you have tried a few branches of the same code.

 FINAL NOTE PLEASE READ AS ITS IMPORTANT!!
 - YOU WILL MOST LIKELY GET AN ERROR SAYING /media/internal/downloads/PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s-main or PPPwn / run.sh does not exist
 - this is intentional, i made a mistake in my code and i cant seem to fix it, however dont worry this is the final step.
 - after you get the error TYPE:

   cd /  
        WILL SHOW THE LOCAL DRIVE
   then type
   cd media/internal/downloads/

   THEN TYPE: ls

      HERE YOU WILL SEE A FOLDER named  PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s-main-main
   Basically im an idiot and i messed up here with the release typo.. but just type;

   mv PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s_v2-main-main PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s_v2-main

   ALL DONE HERE, type CLEAR, then RUN WGET

   wget https://github.com/FinalCionide/PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s_v2/releases/download/Release/install.sh

it will show this 100% |********************************|

type chmod +x ./install.sh
     -  this makes the files we just downloading executable since its a shell script.

 run the program via the console now  TYPE:  ./install.sh


IMPORTANT PART: IT WILL ASK:  PPLGPwn already installed, reinstall? [y/N]

TYPE N  ( Because we renamed the release folder )

YOU ARE NOW READY TO RUN THE PROGRAM..

PLUG IN AN ETHERNET CABLE INTO THE PS4 System and the other end into the back of the LG TV ethernet port and run the program after hitting test connection in PS4 settings

that will send the signal to the RJ45 ports and will start the exploit. 

There are some issues..
- Sometimes PS4 will shut down : Reboot and try again.
- Program hangs : Just reload the ssh.
- Program hangs : Your tv turned off and SSH is closed

   
I will upload a video to you tube showing this method, good luck
if this helped you please leave credit to myself and those on the main project including

# PPLGPwn
A method of executing PPPwn through rooted LGTV's.
This method is using the C++ version of PPPwn, made by xfangfang, the link to the repo it's this one:
https://github.com/xfangfang/PPPwn_cpp

It provides a new way of jailbreaking your PS4, using a rooted LGTV.
For more information of which firmwares are supported, visit the link above.

## Changelog v1.2 -- 16/05/2024
- Added Support for aarch64 TV's
- New option to select if you want PPLGPwn to start when you turn your TV on (Thanks llbranco for the help!)

## Requirements
- Rooted LGTV
- Ethernet cable
- Device to connect to the TV thru ssh (You can use a phone)

## How can I do it?

Firstly you'll need to root your LGTV, the root itself it supported by a couple of models, check both exploits to see if your TV is capable of doing so, more steps on how to root it and activate SSH aswell are available there:
### Root my TV: https://rootmy.tv/
### Dejavuln: https://github.com/throwaway96/dejavuln-autoroot

Secondly, after you jailbreak your own TV (ironic on how we use a jailbroken TV to jailbreak another device lol), you will need to run the ```install.sh``` present in the releases tab on your TV, do it thru this command:

```
FOR THIS FORK BY FinalCionide use: 
wget https://github.com/FinalCionide/PPLGPwn_PS42016A-s/releases/download/Release/install.sh 
```
Ive depriciated the need for 
&& source ./install.sh ( Ignore this )

**Connect your PS4 to your TV through the Ethernet port, and go in your PS4 set up LAN > PPPoE, and the exploit should be working!**

## How can I execute this with just a click of a button?
1. Head to the [Homebrew Store](https://www.webosbrew.org/) app and download [LG Input Hook](https://repo.webosbrew.org/apps/org.webosbrew.inputhook/)

2. Open the LG Input Hook and head to the link the app gives you in a device that has a web browser (you can also do this in your TV, but it will take more time)

3. Setup this custom **Execute** action to any button you'd like:

```
cd /media/internal/downloads/PPLGPwn && chmod +x ./run.sh && ./run.sh
```   

4. Save your changes

**And done!** The button you setup with the custom action will know execute the exploit everytime you press it!

# NOTES
!! This exploit is made for TV's with the armv7 or aarch64 architectures, I'm unsure if it works on any other different arch, to know your TV chip architecture run ```uname -m``` !!

!! This exploit stage2 runs LightningMod's load from usb payload !!

Proudly **ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹** <3

Thanks to the OpenLGTV and the RootMyTV communities that gave us this TV Jailbreak
Also a thanks to everyone in the PS4 jailbreaking community that gave us the exploits!
And also thanks to all the contributors!
